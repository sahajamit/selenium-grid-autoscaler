### Horizontal Pod Scaler for Selenium Grid Kubernetes

This is a small spring boot application which can be used to auto scale the selenium browser pods running inside a kubernetes cluster.

It can give an elasticity to the K8s based selenium grid where the browser nodes can be scaled up/down on demand basis.

To make sure this application does not end up sucking the entire compute power of your cluster, we have a lower and upper cap beyond which the scale will never go.

#### Configurable Properties (found in /src/main/resources/application.properties)
```
gridUrl=http://<Grid_URL_Or_IP>:<Grid_Port>/grid/console
k8s_api_url=https://<Kubernetes HOST>/v3/project/path_to_chrome_deployment

# This property will control the maximum scale to which the browser pods can be scaled up.
node.chrome.max.scale.limit=2

# This property will decide the minimum number of browser pods you want to run all the time. Recommended value is 1.
node.chrome.min.scale.limit=1

## Quick start
- Docker is required: https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/
- Modify the application.properties with what you need
  - All of this can be supplied as environment variables as well
  - Of note the API Bearer token will be required for this to work
- Build the java application
- Run the following to build the container (from the root repo directory):
  - docker build -t selenium-grid-autoscaler .
- Run the following to start the container:
  - docker run selenium-grid-autoscaler
